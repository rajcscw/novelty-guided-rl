# Target (Deadline: Jan 15 & 19 March)

# Restructuring of experiments

## Phase I (FOR IJCNN)

- First, as reviewers pointed out, we have to first try with
non-sequential auto-encoders. This is to show we can replace NN based methods
with neural based.
- Needs tests to test individual components - Like auto encoders and sparse encoders on some sets
- Also, we need a way to visualize the novelty scores
- We also have to experiment on the sparsity of encoders- Like k-sparse encoders. With this, we can
encode more behaviors
- Experiments: Mujoco (dense) and Grid envs (sparse)

## Phase II (For ECML/ICANN)

- We need motivation to switch to sequence based auto-encoders
